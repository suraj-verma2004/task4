                <p>
                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
                    It uses a system of tags to define the structure and content of a webpage, such as headings,
                    paragraphs, images, links, and more. Think of HTML as the skeleton of your website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every element on a webpage, from the smallest piece of text to the largest image,
                    is defined using HTML tags. It's the foundation upon which all web content is built.

                <img src="src/css.jpeg" alt="CSS Styling">
                <p>
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for describing the presentation of a document
                    written in HTML. CSS handles the look and feel of a webpage, including colors, fonts,
                    layout, and responsiveness. It separates content from presentation.

                <ul>
                    <li>Colors and Backgrounds</li>
                    <li>Typography (fonts, sizes, line-height)</li>
                    <li>Layouts (Flexbox, Grid)</li>
                    <li>Animations and Transitions</li>
                    <li>Responsive Design with Media Queries</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    With CSS, you can transform a plain HTML structure into a visually appealing and
                    user-friendly experience.

                <p>
                    Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well
                    on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size.
                    It ensures that your website looks good and functions correctly on desktops, tablets,
                    and mobile phones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Media queries, like those used in this example, are a key component of responsive design.
                    They allow us to apply different CSS rules based on characteristics of the device,
                    such as its width, height, or orientation. This ensures an optimal viewing experience for all users.
